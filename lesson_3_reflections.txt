When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you want to share you project with others, or have your files available for other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-If your repository is public you might not want the chages you have made to be viewable by the public, or pushing data could use up recorces.
